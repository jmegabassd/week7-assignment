## Optional

> 🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

## Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

> I wanted to show on the form when using the drop down menus to display in the stats part of the page, the stats plus traits. I ran out of time + feel pretty exhausted this week and decided to rest and try to get an early night. I also want to make a delete and edit page but again decided to try and get some rest. I have left them in as placeholders.

>
> ## What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

> Initially my form was only sending through the charClass and getting null on name and race, however upon examining the server/form I had used name and race rather than charName and CharRace.

> What went really well and what could have gone better?
> Setting up routes went well, setting up the server get and post also setting up supabase went well.
